**FOMC Responses to Credit Spreads** [with Jeffrey Campbell] (2025).
<!-- 
<details class="research-links"> <summary> Abstract </summary> Achieving the divine coincidence requires setting the private borrowing rate to its value under price flexibility, so the government borrowing rate should fall one-for-one with the private-government spread. Even when Phillips-curve shocks place the divine coincidence out of reach, tracking the natural rate on private borrowing reduces Keynesian fluctuations by offsetting IS-curve shocks. This paper uses an SVAR with the Gilchrist and Zakraj≈°ek (2012) excess bond premium to measure the potential effects of such policy. We estimate that FOMC responses to credit spreads could reduce consumption fluctuations by 20 percent, inflation fluctuations by 10 percent, and unemployment fluctuations by 30 percent.

**Targeted Local Projections** [with Otilia Boldea] (2025).

<!-- <details class="research-links"> <summary> Abstract </summary>     Local projection (LP) and structural vector autoregression (SVAR) are commonly employed to estimate dynamic causal effects of macroeconomic policies at multiple horizons. With enough lags as controls, LP estimators have little bias but their variance increases with the horizon. Due to typically employing fewer lags, SVAR estimators have higher bias but lower variance. We propose to target the LP estimators towards their SVAR counterparts at each horizon, to reduce their variance at the cost of incurring some bias. The resulting targeted LP estimator is a linear combination of the LP and SVAR estimators. We propose choosing this linear combination optimally to minimize the mean-squared error of the new estimator.  In simulations, we demonstrate that under local misspecification of a SVAR identified by ordering, the variance of the local projection estimators is substantially reduced at higher horizons, while maintaining near-nominal coverage in small samples when a moving-block bootstrap is employed.
